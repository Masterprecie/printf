printf - prints the character(s)

#include "main.h"
int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION

printf() functions are inbuilt library functions in C programming language which are available in C library by default. 
These functions are declared and related macros are defined in stdio.h which is a header file in C language.
We have to include stdio.h file as shown in below C program to make use of these printf() and scanf() library functions in C language.
In C programming language, printf() function used to print the character, string, float, integer, octal and hexadecimal values onto the output screen.
We use printf() function with %d format specifier to display the value of an integer variable.
Similarly %c is used to display character, %f for float variable, %s for string variable, %lf for double and %x for hexadecimal variable.
To generate a newline,we use \n in C printf() statement.

c   prints a character variable

s   prints a string variable

d   prints an integer and takes an integer value as a signed decimal integer

i   prints an integer and takes in a decimal, hexadecimal, or octal type

b   prints a binary number

u   prints an unsigned integer

o   prints an octal number

x   prints a hexadecimal number

X   prints a hexadecimal number in caps



RETURN
The function will return the number of characters printed. If unsuccessful the function will return null.

EXAMPLES
To print "Today is Tuesday" you would do as follow, where day is a pointer to a string:

#include "main.h"
_printf("Today is %s", day);

To print "It is 1" you would do as follows, where time is a pointer to a integer:

#include "main.h"
_printf("It is %d", time);
